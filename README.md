# SolarSystemSimulationProject
This is a solar system simulation program made for my Modeling and Simulation course.
To play the simulation, launch the template application file (template.exe) located in the Final folder.
Application is intended to be played in full screen. If it does not launch in fullscreen, please expand the window to fullscreen.
